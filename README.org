#+description: A README file for the Coq-Projects repository
#+author: James Leslie

A selection of Coq files for small projects I have done. Any large projects will be stored under their own repo.

* Projects

** Circles
A project with the main goal of showing that two different definitions of $S^1$ are equal in HoTT. The secondary goal was to get familiar with using higher inductive types.

The main file is [[file:Circles/circles.v][circles.v]].
